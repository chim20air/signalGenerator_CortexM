# signalGenerator_CortexM
A simple signal generator using an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller

### Overview
This was made specifically for the [NUCLEO-F303RE development kit](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f303re.html) using STM CubeMX to configure the board and ARM Keil v5 to program it.
The idea behind this is quite easy, use microcontroller's DAC and one single digital output to make a sine wave, triangular wave and squared wave output
